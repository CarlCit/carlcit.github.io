Anonymity online has become a hot topic in recent years, with many questioning why people would want to hide their identities online. But the truth is, anonymity is not about hiding something, it's about protecting ourselves and our resources from potential harm.

As we increasingly rely on the internet for everything from communication to banking to shopping, it's important to understand how our personal information is being managed and what it is exposed to. By taking the time to understand how things work and implementing some basic precautions, we can shift our thinking to "Why do It need to access to this info/resources by default?"

However, diving into the topic of online privacy can quickly become overwhelming, as it takes us down a rabbit hole of expert-level information and away from the friendly easy-to-use interfaces. That's why it's important to find a balance between privacy and ease of use. This can only be achieved by educating ourselves and others about these issues.

It's important to understand that online privacy is not just about hiding something, it's about protecting ourselves and our resources. By taking the time to educate ourselves and implement some basic precautions, we can ensure that our personal information is safe and secure.
